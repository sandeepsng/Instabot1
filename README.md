# **Why Automate Instagram?**


Instagram has grown to be one of the largest social media platforms. Advertisers, businesses and bloggers have realized it’s potential as a marketplace. These businesses have started maintaining Instagram accounts for their product’s marketing and improving their products’ customer reach. While it is a good idea to start an Instagram account but for large businesses it becomes very time consuming and hectic to run and maintain them. Automation is the answer to this problem. It saves a lot of human effort and time.
On the other hand, we are seeing a boom in new generation bloggers be it travel bloggers, food bloggers or creative writers. These individuals or groups need to be extremely active to increase their reach and engagement with audience. 
To grow their audience, they need some extra features such as tracking competitions, getting hashtags which are most popular in that niche, etc. as well as automate several operations such as liking photos, sending follow requests, accepting follow requests etc.
In this project I aim to automate some tasks and also add some features which are not provided by the Instagram application for the facility of such businesses or individuals.




## For this project report I have decided to work for the niche area of food bloggers. 

Suppose a friend of mine has opened a new Food Blogging handle on Instagram and wants to get famous. He wants to follow a lot of people so that he can get noticed quickly but it is a tedious task so he asks for help. As I have just learned automation using Selenium, I decided to help him by creating an Instagram Bot.

### NOTE:
**_I have divided the project into smaller parts I called them individual tasks to maintain modularity of the project.So u will get every functionality defined as a task in the Jupyter notebook._**


### Technologies used:
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Selenium Webdriver
  - Matplotlib
